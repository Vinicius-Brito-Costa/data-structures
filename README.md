# Data Structures

Recently I have to come back and do some leetcode exercises, the plan was simple i would repeat the old ones that are already completed and going forward from there, easy peasy...

Started with a [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) problem, and kind you not, I cannot make the code pass, tried everything but the result does not change. So in frustation I opened my last submission that have passed, all of my problens would be resolved with a simple ```Set``` data structure.

How could I do not remember that? I don't know, but I have made a mission to study data structures and the implementations all over again.

This repository will hold all the code samples I'have created for this journey, the use cases will be on my personal Obsidian vault (sorry).

## List:

- Stack
  - Python:
    - [Array Implementation](/stack/python/stack_array_implementation.py)
    - [Linked List Implementation](/stack/python/stack_linked_list_implementation.py)
  - Java:
    - [Array Implementation](/stack/java/Stack/src/main/java/org/example/StackArrayImplementation.java)
    - [Linked List Implementation](/stack/java/Stack/src/main/java/org/example/StackLinkedListImplementation.java)
