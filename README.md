# Data Structures

Recently I have had to come back and do some leetcode exercises. The plan was simple: I would repeat the old ones that are already completed and go forward from there, easy peasy...

Started with a [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) problem, and kind you not, I cannot make the code pass, tried everything but the result does not change. So in frustration I opened my last submission that had passed, all of my problems would be resolved with a simple Set data structure.

How could I not remember that? I don't know, but I have made a mission to study data structures and the implementations all over again.

This repository will hold all the code samples I'have created for this journey, the use cases will be in my personal Obsidian vault (sorry).
